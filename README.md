# SchoolManagementSystem
This is a C++ program that simulates a school management system. It was developed as part of an object-oriented programming assignment for Object-Oriented Programming (Îš10) at NKUoA.

## Assignment Prompt ##

The objective of this assignment is to implement a school management system using C++ and object-oriented programming principles. The system should allow users to manage student and teacher data, as well as enroll and drop students from courses.

### Requirements 

Your program must meet the following requirements:

    The program must allow users to add and remove students from the system.
    The program must allow users to add and remove teachers from the system.
    The program must allow users to add and remove courses from the system.
    The program must allow users to enroll and drop students from courses.
    The program must provide a command-line interface for users to interact with the system.
    The program must store data in text files for persistence across multiple runs of the program.
    The program must be implemented using object-oriented programming principles.
    The program must be able to handle errors and exceptions appropriately.
###
### Usage
To run the program, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Once you have the compiler set up, you can compile the program by running the following command:

$ g++ main.cpp -o school_system

Then, to start the program, run the following command:
$ ./school_system 1 2 3 4 5

In my example (above) I used:
capacity of class = 1
level of tiredness (per hour) for junior students = 2
level of tiredness (per hour) for senior students = 3
level of tiredness (per hour) for the teacher = 4
number of operation hours of school = 5

[You can change the values into the integers of your preference]
